                            SENIORS are NEVER FAR, the MATERIAL is NEVER LESS, QUERIES can be
                                    SOLVED, the CONNECTIVITY will NEVER MESS.
                                    
                                    
              FreeOSenior is the Platform through which seniors can share their valuable knowledge,
              material, free courses info, assignments etc. when juniors come through different problems
              faced in daily college life. Moreover they can ask their doubts about different jargons they came
              across in their academics. Seniors will get an easy access to juniors on any kind of promotions or
              they will get the popularity points for the same. Seniors can also segregate juniors on the basis of
              technicality and other skills for making teams etc.

                                                            The Idea
              The basic idea ist ocreate a platform for the different sections of juniors (based on skills like
              competitive programming, IOT etc) no matter where they are and who they are just provide a
              platform to ensure they get to connect with the seniors of their type,their level of intelligence and
              hence perceive a great access to things. In the current situation(COVID-19) this platform can
              be a great help to freshers.
